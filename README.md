# English-Paper-Writing-Method

This README.md records some useful notes on English paper writing, which come from the International Standards for Students' Writing by Brian Devlin.

Some suggestions in paper writing:

1.Clarity, brevity and honesty should be the hallmarks of good scholarly writing.

2.The task of the scholarly writer is to establish a proposition clearly, to give it a context, to link it to what others have written, and to advance reasons why it should be accepted.

3.The crucially important skill that the student writer must develop is the ability to propose a point of view, and to marshall evidence in support of that position, with the aim of persuading an audience of intelligent peers.


The ABC-ISP Framework in this book:

A: Analyse.

think in an analytical way about who they are writing for, on which topic and for what purpose.

B: Brainstorm. 

come up with lots of ideas and try them out before they start writing.
(Map the ideas to see how they relate; Outline them to put them in sequence; Select a key problem to investigate; State the main thesis in one sentence; List the five key words; Define the most imoprtant terms; Draft the initial ideas; Start writing)

C: Convince. 

remind students of the need to construct good arguments, based on believable evidence, that set out to convience the reader of something.
(Set out the claims;Present evidence to support each claim;Make sure that the evidence is warranted;Eliminate faulty logic;Test the ideas in discussion with others.)

I: Improve.

improving the clarity of one's writing through careful revising and editing.

S: Standardise. 

use high quality benchmarks (such as international publishing guidelines) as reference points to guide the development of an extended text.

P: Publish.

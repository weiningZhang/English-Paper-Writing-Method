# English-Paper-Writing-Method

This README.md records some useful notes on English paper writing, which come from the International Standards for Students' Writing by Brian Devlin.

Some suggestions in paper writing:

1.Clarity, brevity and honesty should be the hallmarks of good scholarly writing.

2.The task of the scholarly writer is to establish a proposition clearly, to give it a context, to link it to what others have written, and to advance reasons why it should be accepted.

3.The crucially important skill that the student writer must develop is the ability to propose a point of view, and to marshall evidence in support of that position, with the aim of persuading an audience of intelligent peers.
